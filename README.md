# Digest

Digest is a Python3 script that creates a local version of the weekly Economist magazine that aims to provide an improved reading and listening experience.

Specifically, it:

* Creates a local archive of the weekly edition
* Provides an optimized reading experience
* Easy navigation between sections and articles
* Ability to read offline
* Ability to easy jump to articles on Economist website
* Ability to listen to edition as a podcast, online or off

The project was built to work around performance issues and limitation of the Economist website and mobile application.

## Installation

The script requires Python3 and a number of libraries to be installed. You can install the required libraries with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Before running the script, you must log into economist.com with an account that has access to the weekly edition, using one of the following browsers:

* Firefox (firefox)
* Google Chrome (chrome)
* Microsoft Edge (edge)
* Opera (opera)

and make sure to pass to the script like so:

```bash
python3 digest.py --output-dir ~/tmp/economist/ --cookie-source chrome
```

This is necessary to set the cookies for the script that will authenticate your account.

This will generate a folder in the form of **YYYY-MM-DD** in the specified output directory. The folder will contain an *index.html* file which can be loaded into a browser to access all of the content.

You can find a complete list of options by running:

```bash
python3 digest.py --help
```

## Using the Generated Podcast feed

An XML file will be generated that creates a podcast from the mp3 files for the current weekly edition. It is generated in serial mode with the order of the episodes based on the order of the articles online.

This file can be used to create a podcast to listen through the weekly edition, as well as sync all of the files offline to listen when you don't have network coverage.

Each podcast / URL represents a single weekly edition, and you will need to generate and add a new url for new editions.

You can find info on how to add the URL to Apple podcast [here](https://podcasters.apple.com/support/828-test-your-podcast)

Note that the mp3 files are not downloaded by the script, but rather they are linked to their online location.

Also, in order to add the URL to your podcasting app, you may need to host it online when you add it.
